            <p>Interested in learning how to use computer programming for digital art and design? This two-day workshop introduces participants to software tools to create procedural art. In it, we cover <a href="http://processing.org"  target="_blank">Processing</a>, a programming language for visual art, and <a href="http://paradrawing.com"  target="_blank">Para</a>, a new direct-manipulation procedural drawing tool developed by Adobe Research and the MIT Media Lab. You will learn the basics of these tools and have the opportunity to create a finished piece of procedural art with assistance from the instructors.</p>
